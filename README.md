# React and Redux

An easy way to learn through examples

## Before starting

After several years of contributing, mentoring and working with React and Redux, I decided to “put together” some notes related to recurrent doubts and contrarieties that friends and co-workers have faced.

This is a pure practical guide; I don´t have the intention of challenging the great tutorials and books that you can find in the market (like the own Facebook´s proprietary documentation). My aim as I stated before is –clearly- pragmatic. You will see some concepts and technicalities (as general context) but you should complement this joint exercise with other materials (I try to avoid quoting since discovering good sources is also part of the training, however, taking a look the the mother source will not hurt you: [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)).
