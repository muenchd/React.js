An easy way to learn through examples.

## Before starting

_2/21/19 UPDATE_: Many things happened in React and its ecosystem. I will try to update the sections to React 16.\*.\* and go deeper in the “Life cycle” paragraph.\*

After several years of contributing, mentoring and working with React and Redux (among other related technologies of `JAMStack`), I decided to “put together” some notes linked to recurrent doubts and contrarieties that friends and co-workers have faced.

This is a pure practical guide: please, keep the `practical intention` present during the course of these "shared topics"; I don´t have the purpose of challenging the great and innumerous coaching classes, neither the books/"white papers" that you can find in the market (starting with the own Facebook´s proprietary documentation).

My aim as I stated before is –clearly- pragmatic. You will see some concepts and technicalities (as general and fair context) but you should (perhaps must) complement this joint exercise with other materials (I try to avoid quoting or referencing since, an important part of your training is discovering good sources and picking those that satisfy your own and extremely personal needs.
However, taking a look the the mother source will not hurt you: [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

You DO need to have an intermediate knowledge in `JavaScript` and, preferably, some exposure to [ES6](http://es6-features.org)
Even when complex topics are addressed as needed part of the "session" (for example leaks, currying) not having a JS base at all will generate more doubts and it could guide you to a premature failure.
If you don´t have experience with JavaScript, familiarity with `OOP`... Please, resolve `this` and `then` come back (btw, if this phrase is catchy or understandable, you should be alright).

Before proceeding with the tutorial, please, be sure that you have installed or, install...

**Required**

* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Package manager (npm or yarn)

Note: packages, dependencies, libraries are going to be referenced on-demand. Those whose scope is bigger (or represent some kind of particular difficulty) will be addressed in [Packages.md](Packages.md)

**Recommended**

* npm (bundled with Node)
  More info: https://github.com/npm/npm

* For Windows users: Git bash https://git-scm.com/downloads as a CMD replace.

**Alternatives**

* yarn (alternative to npm): https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
