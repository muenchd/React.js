At this point, you should be familiar with `static imports` like `import { myFunction } from './helpers'`. However, a new async or dynamic way of importing ES modules is going to be available soon. Check [tc39 > proposal-dynamic-import
](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import).

Currently, we import all the required modules (at the top of our file), compile them and generate a bundle, without the possibility of loading a module on-demand (or dynamically), for example, when a user clicks on a button, when certain condition is met (like a change on a state property), etc.

Imagine if you were able to freely load modules at the runtime.

Example:

```javaScript
button.addEventListener('click', event => {
    e.preventDefault();
    import('./moreInformation.js')
    .then(moreInformation => {
        moreInformation.load();
    })
    .catch(error => {
        //...
    })
});
```

What happens behind the scenes is easy: we return a Promise that will be resolved on a certain time point, retrieving the module with its entire functionality.
